First p5.js project.
Fork this via `https://github.com/BlueBonsai21/p5.js-projects`.
To launch a block click then a line will appear. That'll be the initial velocity of the block.
There are unwanted behaviours I was way too lazy to fix. Overall, it's a very simple system that's meant just to get handy with p5.js.
No updates to come.
